There are limitations to the games I can add.  
- Only browser games. Please don't ask for Fortnite or Roblox.
- No online multiplayer games. Since the multiplayer servers for games can and will be blocked for most people, I cannot do online multiplayer.
- No unlocking Ibsites or streaming services. Once again, I are broke and can't afford servers. 
- That's it, I guess
  
As I said, please feel free to make a pull request to accomplish these features.
