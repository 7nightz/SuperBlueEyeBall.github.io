# GmingRealm Reborn
## Welcome!
This my gaming site but reborn and better!
I  used to have a gaming site on replit, but it broke down for some reason, and got blocked. Replit later became horrible anyways because you can't even host anything besides a temporary replit.dev site.
I have finally gathered the courage to restart it, ands it better than ever.

The owner of this repository is SuperBlueEyeball, who has made pretty much everything.
Also, thank you SipSup3314 for letting me use ShadowGmes as a template for website. It has helped me learned the ways of HTML5 and become a better developer.

This is NOT a copy of ShadowGmes, better yet just used as a template for my redo of my site. Credits and licence to ShadowGmes / SipSup3314.
