# Shadow's Games
This project has a license so don't even try to copy it. You can fork it and give credit, but no claiming it's yours. Self hosting and hosting providers are fine WITH CREDIT AND LICENSE. Also all games here are not mine so you can have them.

The License clearly states that this is my repository, @sunflower4166, and not anyone else's. Anyone (@sunflower4166) claiming that they made their fork (https://github.com/sunflower4166/shadowgmes.github.io) is speaking crap and will be in a whole lot of legal stuff (@sunflower4166). The License also states that you may not distribute closed source versions. If you see a copy of this repo, add /LICENSE to the end of the URL and check if it has my name and copyright on it (Oliver Salameh). If it doesn't, report it to me through an issue and I WILL take legal action.
